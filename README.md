# Japanese Radio Act - JSON-LD Project

This repository aims to provide a structured, machine-readable version of the Japanese Radio Act using the JSON-LD format. It is intended for developers, legal technologists, and researchers who wish to parse, analyze, and reuse legal data efficiently.

## Purpose

* Digitally encode the Japanese Radio Act in a bilingual (Japanese/English) JSON-LD format
* Enable semantic web and linked data usage in legal and regulatory technologies
* Facilitate AI-based legal processing, annotation, and natural language understanding

## Features

* Article-by-article JSON-LD representation
* @context definition for consistent semantic labeling
* Bilingual support (Japanese original and English translation)

## Sources

* Japanese original: [e-Gov Law System (e-Gov法令系)](https://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/)
